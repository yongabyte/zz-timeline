# Zz Plant Growth Timeline - Next.js Project

Welcome to the Zz Plant Growth Timeline project built with Next.js! This project showcases the journey of a Zz plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia), also known as the Zanzibar Gem, as it grows from a single leaf during the height of the pandemic. Follow along as we document the various stages of its growth with pictures and descriptions.

## About the Zz Plant

The Zz plant, scientifically known as Zamioculcas zamiifolia, is a popular indoor plant known for its resilience and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its glossy, dark green leaves make it an attractive addition to any space. During the pandemic, many people turned to indoor gardening as a therapeutic and fulfilling hobby, and the Zz plant was a perfect choice for those looking for a low-maintenance and visually appealing plant companion.

## Project Overview

This project aims to document the growth of a Zz plant from a single leaf cutting. We've captured various stages of its development and created a timeline to share this journey with you. Each stage is represented by a photo, allowing you to witness the plant's progress over time.

**Note:** We've used the `react-chrono` component to create the interactive timeline in this project.
